# CI Pipeline Test

This file is created to test the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline implementation for Phase 5.

## Test Objectives

### âœ… Build Stage
- [x] Node.js environment setup (v20)
- [x] Package manager detection (pnpm/npm/yarn)
- [x] Dependency installation with caching
- [x] Next.js build process
- [x] Standalone output generation

### âœ… Quality Assurance
- [x] ESLint code quality checks
- [x] TypeScript type checking
- [x] Unit test execution
- [x] Test report generation

### âœ… Docker Operations
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile build
- [x] Image optimization and security
- [x] Health check integration
- [x] Registry push (Docker Hub)

### ðŸ”„ Deployment (main branch only)
- [ ] SSH connection to production VM
- [ ] Container deployment via deploy.sh
- [ ] Health endpoint verification
- [ ] Application availability check

## Pipeline Verification

This test branch should trigger the Jenkins pipeline and execute:

1. **Checkout**: Source code retrieval from GitHub
2. **Setup**: Node.js 20 installation and caching
3. **Install**: Dependency resolution with proper package manager
4. **Lint**: ESLint verification of code quality
5. **TypeCheck**: TypeScript compilation check
6. **Test**: Jest unit test execution
7. **Build**: Next.js production build
8. **Docker Build**: Multi-stage container creation
9. **Docker Push**: Image upload to registry (if on main)
10. **Deploy**: Production deployment (main branch only)

## Expected Results

For this **test branch (PR)**:
- âœ… All CI stages should pass
- âœ… No deployment should occur
- âœ… Docker image should be built but not pushed
- âœ… Test reports should be generated

For **main branch** (after merge):
- âœ… Full pipeline including deployment
- âœ… Docker image push to registry
- âœ… Production VM deployment
- âœ… Health check validation

## Test Timestamp

**Created**: August 25, 2025  
**Purpose**: Phase 5 Task 7 - CI Pipeline Verification  
**Branch**: test/ci-pipeline-verification  
**Expected Duration**: 10-15 minutes
