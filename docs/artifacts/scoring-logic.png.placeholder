# Scoring Logic Placeholder

## üñºÔ∏è IMAGE PLACEHOLDER - TO BE REPLACED

**Filename**: scoring-logic.png
**Size**: 1600x1200 pixels
**Format**: PNG with high quality

## üìã Content Description
This image should contain a visual representation of the AI scoring logic showing:

### Input Data Section
- Loan application form with sample values
- Borrower information fields

### Scoring Weights Breakdown
- **Credit Score (35%)**: 300-850 range, normalization formula
- **Debt-to-Income (25%)**: 0-100% range, lower is better
- **Income vs Amount (25%)**: Loan-to-income ratio calculation
- **Employment History (10%)**: Years of stability factor
- **Loan Term (5%)**: Term length impact

### Guardrails & Hard Rules
- Credit Score < 500 ‚Üí Automatic Rejection
- DTI Ratio > 60% ‚Üí Automatic Rejection
- EMI > 40% Income ‚Üí Automatic Rejection
- Score Cap at 0.65 ‚Üí Maximum achievable

### Calculation Flow
- Weighted sum formula visualization
- Score computation example
- Range: 0.0 - 0.65

### Decision Thresholds
- **‚â•0.70**: APPROVED (High Confidence)
- **‚â•0.55**: UNDER_REVIEW (Manual Assessment)
- **<0.55**: REJECTED (Low Confidence)

### Explanation Generation
- 3-6 reason examples
- Positive and negative factor examples
- Business-friendly language samples

### Alternative Model
- Logistic regression coefficients
- Sigmoid function visualization
- Model toggle mechanism

## üé® Visual Guidelines
- Flow chart style with clear decision points
- Color coding for different score ranges (green/yellow/red)
- Mathematical formulas clearly displayed
- Example calculations with real numbers
- Clean, professional business presentation style

## üìù Generation Notes
- Source: `/docs/artifacts/scoring-logic.md` (Mermaid syntax)
- Tool: Mermaid to PNG, or business process diagram tools
- Alternative: Lucidchart, Visio for decision flow diagrams
- Include mathematical notation and example calculations
