# AI Loan Approval System — DevOps-Ready MVP
## Next.js · Supabase · Jenkins · Docker

---

### Problem & Motivation

Loan desks are overloaded with repetitive applications. Manual triage delays approvals and increases operational costs. We need a minimal, auditable system that **authenticates users**, **collects loan inputs**, and **automatically scores** applications to **approve / reject / mark for review**—with a modern DevOps pipeline for quick, reliable releases.

### Objectives

• Build a **full-stack** app (Next.js) with **Supabase Auth + RLS** for per-user data isolation  
• Implement a **transparent AI scoring** (rule-based + explanations) with guarded thresholds  
• Provide **loan lifecycle**: create → list → view → decide  
• Set up **CI/CD** with **Jenkins + Docker** and **single-VM deploy** (health checks + rollback)

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Authentication with Supabase Auth and Row Level Security (RLS)
- Loan CRUD operations with complete lifecycle management
- AI decision endpoint with rule-based scoring and explanations
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Docker containerization with health checks and rollback capabilities

**Out of Scope (for now):**
- Heavy ML training and complex neural networks
- Kubernetes orchestration and multi-environment deployments  
- Advanced blue/green deployment strategies

### Architecture

Next.js server routes + Supabase (Postgres+Auth) under RLS; AI scorer as a pure TypeScript module; Jenkins builds & tests → Docker image → VM deploy via SSH script. Complete separation of concerns with modular, testable components.

**Key Tools:** Next.js 14, Supabase, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui, TypeScript, Vitest, Jenkins, Docker

### Technical Implementation

**Frontend:** Modern React-based UI with server-side rendering, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, TypeScript for type safety

**Backend:** Supabase Backend-as-a-Service providing PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication, Row Level Security policies for data isolation, RESTful API design

**AI Scoring:** Transparent rule-based algorithm with weighted factors (Credit Score 35%, DTI 25%, Income Ratio 25%, Employment 10%, Term 5%), configurable thresholds, optional logistic regression model

**DevOps:** 10-stage Jenkins pipeline (checkout, setup, install, lint, typecheck, test, build, docker build/push, deploy, cleanup), Docker multi-stage builds, SSH-based VM deployment with health verification

**Security:** Row Level Security ensuring users only access their own data, admin override capabilities, comprehensive audit logging, secure secrets management

### Expected Outcome

A working MVP that **securely processes loans**, **explains decisions transparently**, and **ships via automated pipeline**; ready for extension to richer ML models and scaling strategies post-Review-1. The system demonstrates modern DevOps practices with automated testing, containerization, and reliable deployment processes.

### Business Impact

- **Reduced Processing Time:** Automated scoring eliminates manual triage delays
- **Improved Consistency:** Rule-based decisions ensure fair, auditable outcomes  
- **Operational Efficiency:** DevOps automation enables rapid feature delivery
- **Risk Management:** Comprehensive guardrails and audit trails ensure compliance
- **Scalability Foundation:** Modern architecture ready for future ML enhancements
