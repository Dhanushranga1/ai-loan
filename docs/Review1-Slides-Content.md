## Slide 2: Problem & Objectives

**Problem Statement:**
Loan desks are overloaded with repetitive applications, causing delays and increased operational costs.

**Key Objectives:**
• **Full-Stack App**: Next.js with Supabase Auth + RLS for data isolation
• **Transparent AI Scoring**: Rule-based algorithm with clear explanations
• **Complete Loan Lifecycle**: Create → List → View → Decide
• **Modern CI/CD**: Jenkins + Docker with automated testing and deployment

**Speaker Notes:** The financial services industry struggles with manual loan processing. Our solution provides automated, transparent decision-making with a robust DevOps foundation for reliable deployments.

## Slide 3: Scope & Assumptions

**In Scope:**
✅ Authentication & Row Level Security
✅ Loan CRUD with AI decisioning
✅ Audit logging & compliance
✅ CI/CD pipeline with Docker deployment

**Out of Scope (Current Phase):**
❌ Heavy ML training & neural networks
❌ Kubernetes orchestration
❌ Multi-environment blue/green deployment

**Key Assumptions:**
• Single VM deployment sufficient for MVP
• Rule-based scoring provides transparency
• Supabase RLS handles data security

**Speaker Notes:** We focused on delivering a production-ready MVP with clear boundaries. The architecture is designed to scale to more complex ML models and infrastructure in future phases.

## Slide 4: System Architecture

**[INSERT: architecture-diagram.png]**

**Key Components:**
• **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
• **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
• **AI Engine**: TypeScript scoring module
• **DevOps**: Jenkins → Docker → VM deployment
• **Security**: Row Level Security for data isolation

**Speaker Notes:** Our architecture follows modern full-stack patterns with clear separation of concerns. Supabase provides the backend infrastructure while our custom AI scorer handles decision logic. The DevOps pipeline ensures reliable deployments.

## Slide 5: Database & Security (RLS)

**[INSERT: db-erd.png + RLS Policy Summary]**

**Database Tables:**
• **profiles**: User management with role-based access
• **loans**: Application data with status tracking
• **decisions**: AI scoring results with explanations
• **audit_logs**: Complete action tracking for compliance

**RLS Security Model:**
• **Owner Access**: `user_id = auth.uid()` for data isolation
• **Admin Override**: `profiles.role = 'admin'` for management
• **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with user context

**Speaker Notes:** Security is built into the database layer with Row Level Security policies. Users can only access their own data, while admins have override capabilities. Every action is audited for compliance.

## Slide 6: AI Scoring & Guardrails

**[INSERT: scoring-logic.png]**

**Scoring Weights:**
• Credit Score (35%) • Debt-to-Income (25%) • Income vs Amount (25%)
• Employment History (10%) • Loan Term (5%)

**Decision Thresholds:**
• **≥0.70**: APPROVED (High Confidence)
• **≥0.55**: UNDER_REVIEW (Manual Assessment)
• **<0.55**: REJECTED (Low Confidence)

**Guardrails:**
• Credit < 500 → Auto Reject • DTI > 60% → Auto Reject • EMI > 40% → Auto Reject

**Speaker Notes:** Our scoring algorithm is transparent and auditable. The weighted approach considers multiple factors while guardrails ensure responsible lending. All decisions include explanations for transparency.

## Slide 7: CI/CD Pipeline

**[INSERT: ci-cd-pipeline.png]**

**10-Stage Pipeline:**
1. Checkout → 2. Setup → 3. Install → 4. Lint → 5. Type Check
6. Test → 7. Build → 8. Docker Build → 9. Push → 10. Deploy

**Key Features:**
• **Parallel Quality Checks**: Lint, TypeCheck, Test run simultaneously
• **Health Verification**: Post-deployment validation
• **Automatic Rollback**: Previous image restoration on failure
• **Zero Downtime**: Container replacement strategy

**Speaker Notes:** Our Jenkins pipeline implements modern CI/CD best practices with parallel processing, comprehensive testing, and automated recovery. The 10-stage approach ensures quality while maintaining fast feedback loops.

## Slide 8: Demo Flow (Live)

**Complete Workflow Demonstration:**

1. **User Registration** → Supabase Auth with profile creation
2. **New Loan Application** → Form submission with validation
3. **AI Decision Processing** → Score calculation with explanations
4. **Results Display** → Decision status with detailed reasons
5. **Pipeline Trigger** → Jenkins build and deployment
6. **Health Verification** → System status confirmation

**Real-Time Elements:**
• Live application interface • Jenkins pipeline execution • Health endpoint responses

**Speaker Notes:** [LIVE DEMO] We'll now demonstrate the complete system workflow from user registration through loan processing and deployment pipeline execution. This shows the integration of all components.

## Slide 9: Evidence (Screenshots)

**Development Evidence:**
✅ Jenkins green build status
✅ Docker Hub registry tags
✅ VM container deployment

**Application Evidence:**
✅ User interface and navigation
✅ Loan processing workflow
✅ AI decision results

**Infrastructure Evidence:**
✅ Health endpoint responses
✅ Supabase RLS policies

## Slide 10: Risks & Mitigations

**Technical Risks:**
• **Container Crashes** → Health checks + automatic rollback
• **Secret Exposure** → Environment variables + secure deployment
• **Database Performance** → RLS optimization + proper indexing

**Project Risks:**
• **Scope Creep** → Phased development approach
• **Integration Issues** → Comprehensive testing pipeline
• **Deployment Failures** → Automated recovery procedures

**Business Risks:**
• **Regulatory Compliance** → Audit logging + transparent decisions
• **Data Security** → RLS policies + authentication controls

**Speaker Notes:** We've identified and mitigated key risks through technical solutions and process improvements. The system includes comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Slide 11: Roadmap (Post-Review-1)

**Immediate Enhancements:**
• **Advanced ML Models**: Logistic regression → Neural networks
• **Admin Dashboard**: User management and system monitoring
• **Enhanced Observability**: Metrics, logging, alerting

**Medium-Term Goals:**
• **Kubernetes Deployment**: Container orchestration and scaling
• **Multi-Environment Pipeline**: Dev → Staging → Production
• **Performance Optimization**: Caching, CDN, database tuning

**Long-Term Vision:**
• **Microservices Architecture**: Service decomposition
• **Real-Time Processing**: Streaming data and instant decisions
• **Advanced Analytics**: Business intelligence and reporting

**Speaker Notes:** Our roadmap shows clear progression from MVP to enterprise-scale solution. The current architecture provides a solid foundation for these enhancements.

## Slide 12: Q&A

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: Why rule-based vs ML model?**
A: Transparency, auditability, zero training infrastructure; ready to toggle logistic model later.

**Q: How is data isolated between users?**
A: Supabase RLS policies ensure users only see rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`.

**Q: What's your rollback strategy?**
A: Keep previous image tags; automated script stops current container and starts last successful version.

**Q: How do you ensure system reliability?**
A: Unit tests, health checks, transactional operations, and comprehensive CI pipeline gating.

**Q: What about secret security?**
A: Runtime environment files on VM; no service roles in client-side code.

**Speaker Notes:** These questions cover the most common technical and architectural concerns. Be prepared to dive deeper into any area based on audience interest and expertise level.
