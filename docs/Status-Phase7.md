# Phase 7 Status Report - Post-Review Hardening

## Executive Summary
Phase 7 focuses on production hardening with minimal admin views, E2E testing, observability, and security enhancements. This phase builds on the Review-1 deliverables to create a day-to-day operational system.

## Phase 7 Objectives

### 🔐 Admin Functionality (Read-Only)
- **Admin Loans List**: `/admin/loans` with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Admin Loan Detail**: `/admin/loans/[id]` with decision timeline and history
- **Role-Based Access**: Server-side guards ensuring admin-only access
- **Audit Integration**: Optional admin notes logged to audit_logs

### 🧪 End-to-End Testing
- **Playwright Integration**: Automated E2E smoke tests
- **Core Flow Coverage**: Login → Create Loan → Run Decision → Verify Results
- **CI Integration**: Optional headless test execution in Jenkins pipeline
- **Data Isolation**: Test user management with RLS compliance

### 📊 Observability & Operations
- **Operational Runbook**: Health checks, logging, rollback procedures
- **Structured Logging**: Info/warn/error logs in API routes (no secrets)
- **Build Information**: Footer displaying deployed commit SHA
- **Monitoring Integration**: Enhanced health endpoint documentation

### 🛡️ Security & Performance Hardening
- **Security Headers**: CSP-lite, HSTS, no-sniff, frame-deny via middleware
- **Rate Limiting**: Decision endpoint protection (3/min per user)
- **Environment Validation**: Zod-based env validation on server boot
- **Accessibility**: Form labels, aria-live regions, focus management

## Implementation Progress

### Outputs Created
*[To be filled as tasks complete]*

### Technical Achievements
*[To be documented during implementation]*

### Quality Metrics
*[To be measured during testing]*

## Gaps & Next Steps

### Current Phase Scope
- Read-only admin views (no data mutation beyond audit notes)
- Smoke E2E tests (not comprehensive test coverage)
- Basic security headers (not full CSP implementation)
- In-memory rate limiting (not distributed/persistent)

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Advanced admin dashboards with analytics
- Comprehensive E2E test suite covering edge cases
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis
- Advanced observability with metrics and alerting
- Performance monitoring and optimization
