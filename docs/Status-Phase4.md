- **Configuration**: Adjustable interval via environment variable

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **AI Scoring**: Complete test suite for rule-based scoring engine

## 📊 Decision Thresholds

| Threshold | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Approve   | 0.70 (70%)   | Score required for automatic approval |
| Review    | 0.55 (55%)   | Score required to avoid rejection |
| Reject    | < 0.55       | Scores below review threshold |

## 🔍 Scoring Weights

| Feature | Weight | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Credit Score | 35% | Primary creditworthiness indicator |
| DTI Ratio | 25% | Debt sustainability measure |
| EMI Ratio | 25% | Payment affordability check |
| Employment Years | 10% | Income stability factor |
| Amount vs Income | 5% | Loan size appropriateness |

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- **Decisions**: `loan_id`, `created_at DESC`, `(loan_id, input_hash)`
- **Loan Applications**: Enhanced indexes for decision workflow
- **Query Performance**: Sub-100ms decision retrieval

### Caching Strategy
- **Decision Cache**: Recent decision lookup via input hash
- **Feature Cache**: Computed features stored for idempotency
- **Response Optimization**: Minimal data transfer for cached responses

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive feature validation

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Single Model**: Only rule-based scoring fully integrated (logistic model available but not default)
2. **Fixed Thresholds**: Decision thresholds require environment variable updates
3. **Basic Explanations**: Limited to predefined explanation patterns
4. **No ML Training**: Logistic model uses fixed coefficients
